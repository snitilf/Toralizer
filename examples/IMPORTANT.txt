IMPORTANT: example scripts and system integrity protection (sip)

the example scripts (check-ip.sh, check-geo.sh, test-anonymity.sh) use curl
to fetch data from the internet. however, if curl is located at /usr/bin/curl,
it's protected by macOS system integrity protection and cannot be intercepted.

WHY IT MATTERS:
- test-with-binary.sh ALWAYS works (uses test_http, not sip-protected)
- other scripts may NOT work if you only have system curl

HOW TO FIX:
install homebrew curl (not sip-protected):

    brew install curl

the scripts will automatically detect and use it (even if it's keg-only).

note: homebrew curl is "keg-only" by default, meaning it's installed at
/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin/curl instead of /opt/homebrew/bin/curl.
the scripts now check both locations automatically.

VERIFY IT WORKS:
    # should show DIFFERENT ips
    cd examples
    ./check-ip.sh

PROOF TORALIZER WORKS:
even without homebrew curl, you can prove toralizer works:

    cd ..
    ./toralize ./test_http

if you see [toralize] messages, it's working!

BOTTOM LINE:
- toralizer itself works fine
- the limitation is macOS security blocking system binaries
- install homebrew curl to use all example scripts
- or just use test-with-binary.sh which always works
